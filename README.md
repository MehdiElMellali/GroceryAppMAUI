# E-Commerce Grocery App Readme

## Introduction

This README provides an overview of an E-Commerce Grocery App built using .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI). The app is designed to help users shop for groceries, manage their shopping lists, and order products from an online store. The app utilizes .NET MAUI's navigation using Shell, follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, incorporates various controls, converters, and connects to external APIs for product data.

## Technology Stack

- **.NET MAUI:** The app is built using .NET MAUI, a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop applications.

- **Xamarin.Forms Shell:** The navigation within the app is implemented using Xamarin.Forms Shell, making it easy to define the app's structure and navigation hierarchy.

- **MVVM:** The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, separating concerns and improving code maintainability.

- **Xamarin.Forms Controls:** Various Xamarin.Forms controls are used to create a user-friendly interface, including ListView, Entry, Button, etc.

- **Value Converters:** Converters are used to transform data between the ViewModel and the View.

- **API Integration:** External APIs are integrated to fetch product data, prices, and availability.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
- **`GroceryApp`**: The main .NET MAUI project.
  - **`Models`**: Data models and entities.
  - **`ViewModels`**: ViewModels that manage the presentation logic.
  - **`Views`**: XAML files for user interfaces.
  - **`Services`**: Services to handle data retrieval and processing.
  - **`Converters`**: Value converters for data transformations.
  - **`API`**: API client for fetching product data.
  - **`Helpers`**: Utility classes and helper functions.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
3. Build and run the app on your preferred platform (Android, iOS, etc.).

## Navigation

The app uses Xamarin.Forms Shell for navigation. The navigation structure is defined in the `AppShell.xaml` file, specifying the hierarchy of pages and tabs.

## MVVM Architecture

The MVVM pattern separates the application into three components: Models, ViewModels, and Views. This separation enhances code reusability and testability.

- **Models**: Define the data structure and entities used in the app.
- **ViewModels**: Implement the business logic, handle user interactions, and prepare data for the views.
- **Views**: Define the user interface using XAML, and bind it to the ViewModel.

## Controls

The app uses a variety of Xamarin.Forms controls to create a responsive and user-friendly interface, including ListView, Entry, Button, and more.

## Converters

Value converters are used to format and transform data between the ViewModel and the View. For example, converting a price in cents to dollars, formatting dates, and other data transformations.

## API Integration

The app connects to external APIs to fetch product data. This includes retrieving product details, prices, and stock availability.
